# Workgroup assignment 1

In this workgroup exercise you'll need to put together wikipedia profiles
for all group members in the same website. 

You'll create a small wikipedia-like website with just some articles,
one for each one of you and one for the classes you're doing in IE.

## How to approach the problem

- Decide a structure that all articles should follow.  You'll probably
  need a header, menu...
- Create CSS rules for all different parts that your articles will have.
- Modify all your articles to fit the previously decided structure
